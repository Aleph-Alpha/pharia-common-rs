# Internal Pharia Rust SDK

A crate intended to be used by Aleph Alpha employees to write Rust Services for Pharia.

## About

With a growing number of different teams at Pharia utilizing Rust we find that the same problems are solved repeatedly. The current trigger for creatingn this library is implementing authorization against our IAM for yet another service.

This effort aims to both encapsualte knowledge about our artefacts, as well as conventions in Aleph Alpha in general as well as Rust artefacts in particular.
